              <h2>Overview</h2>

              <p>Over the last two years I have been working for the Students’ Union I have had a healthy dose of variety in my job. Around a central set of events it is amazing how much variance gets into the day-to-day activity.</p>
              <p>One common element over the past year and a half was the website theme. As a developer by trade this was going to be my ‘masterpiece’ or so I hoped. If any project was going to be it it was this.</p>
              <h3>Why did we need to do this?</h3>
              <p>The old site had not aged well. Unresponsive, grey and difficult to work with for day-to-day web work. The plan was to install a new responsive, well documented framework. With the aim&nbsp;speed up future development work.</p>
              <p>I settled on&nbsp;<a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/" data-cke-saved-href="http://foundation.zurb.com/">Foundation 5&nbsp;</a>from Zurb.&nbsp;At the time it was the most up-to-date version of their responsive framework. Halfway into&nbsp;work&nbsp;they launched Foundation 6&nbsp;(a&nbsp;plan to update to six is currently in the works).</p>
              <p>One of the main challenges was managing code between production, staging,&nbsp;and development. With source code entered in the browser, I needed to find a way to use my workflow to produce high quality code. Then move it to staging to test. Using Coda and CodeKit to manage local code changes, then copied the minified code to the browser. Once happy with a feature or development, commit to the repo and move to the next todo.</p>
              <h3>What makes up an MSL Skin?</h3>
              <p>Dust, bits of grit and a whole lot of duct tape:</p>
              <p><strong>Snippets</strong> – Bits of reusable HTML that have fragmented functionality. I.e – the html head content that is used on each page. Using a snippet means you can reuse the same code on many pages.</p>
              <p><strong>Templates</strong> – These are the page templates themselves. Using code to layout what pages look like. Setting where the page content lives (these are the only things that don’t live in the repo at the moment).</p>
              <p><strong>Site Assets / Globals</strong> – These are scripts and styles that are uploaded to the site. Foundation core modules live in the site assets area.</p>
              <p>The redevelopment received <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yciX2meIkXI" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yciX2meIkXI">with much rejoicing</a>. No quite as python but the small amount of&nbsp;feedback I have had has been positive. Online&nbsp;engagement&nbsp;have increased&nbsp;but the website is just the&nbsp;delivery channel. The content is what is on the cards for improving next. I’m now focusing on building links with our IT and design courses to get them involved with our design work.</p>
              <p>Have a look at the new site&nbsp;<a href="https://www.yourstudentsunion.com/">here</a>. I ran two&nbsp;<a href="http://peek.usertesting.com/" data-cke-saved-href="http://peek.usertesting.com">Peek</a>&nbsp;sessions against the site shortly after the design went live that you can view&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/CSG7zluVros" data-cke-saved-href="https://youtu.be/CSG7zluVros">here</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/bP9t29ittsc" data-cke-saved-href="https://youtu.be/bP9t29ittsc">here</a>.</p>
